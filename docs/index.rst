python-args
===========

``python-args``, inspired by `attrs <attrs.org>`__, removes the boilerplate
of processing arguments to functions and methods.

Decorating your functions with ``python-args`` can make your code more
composable, more readable, and easier to test. Along with this, functions
decorated with ``python-args`` can be used to build more expressive interfaces
and integrations on top of them.

In order to get started, first go through the
:ref:`installation instructions <installation>`. Then head on to the
:ref:`python-args tutorial <tutorial>`.
